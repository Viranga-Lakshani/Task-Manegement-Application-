# Vue.js Task Manager - A Simple To-Do App

This is a really simple task management app built with Vue.js. It's designed to be straightforward and easy to use â€“ perfect for keeping track of your daily to-dos.

## What it Does

Basically, this app lets you:

*   Add new tasks to your list.
*   See all your tasks in a clean list.
*   Delete tasks when you've finished them.

It's pretty basic, but it's a good starting point for learning Vue.js or just having a quick and dirty to-do list.

## Tech Used

We're using:

*   Vue.js (of course!)
*   Vite (for super-fast development)
